# Contributing Guideline

Welcome to the PromptTrail project! We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to our project!

## Development Setup

- We use [rye](https://rye-up.com/) to manage our Python development environment.
- You can run an example as follows:
  - Installing rye (See their [website](https://rye-up.com/) for the latest installation instruction)
    - `curl -sSf https://rye-up.com/get | bash`
  - Clone this repository where you want
    - `git clone https://github.com/combinatrix-ai/PromptTrail.git`
  - Setup the environment
    - `cd PromptTrail`
    - Install dependencies
      - `rye sync`
    - Activate the environment
      - `rye shell`
  - Run an example
    - `python -m examples.example_openai.py`
      - You may need to set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to run this example.

## Before you make PRs

- Please make sure that your code passes all tests. (adding tests is always welcome!)
  - `rye run test`
- Please make sure that your code is auto-formatted. (black, autoflake, isort)
  - `rye run format`
- Please make sure that your code passes the lint check. (mypy)
  - `rye run lint`
- Please build documentation if you change the public interface. (sphinx)
  - `rye run doc`

Note: You can run all of these commands at once by `rye run all`. GitHub Actions will run these commands automatically in check mode when you make a PR. If any of these checks fail, please run these commands locally and fix the errors.

## Coding Principles

### Type Checking

- We use pylance (strict) on vscode and mypy.
  - We prefer repeating duplicated type checking code over using `Any` or # type: ignore.
