# About
PromptTrail is a library designed for LLM programming.

# Project Overview
- PromptTrail is a lightweight library that helps you build applications with LLMs.
- It provides a unified interface to various LLMs (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Local LLMs) and a simple DSL for "Agent as Code".
- It also offers developer tools for prompt programming, including LLM mocking for testing.

# Project Setup
- This project is managed with rye and pyproject.toml.
  - requirements.lock and requirements-dev.lock files should not be edited directly. Use `rye sync` to update them.
- The project uses the following development tools: black, pautoflake, isort, mypy, flake8, and pytest.
- You can run all these checks at once before committing by running `rye run all`.
- Your environment is already configured with the necessary API keys. To install additional packages, run `rye add package-name` followed by `rye sync`.
- For debugging purposes, the library uses `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`. Users can view API calls and other information by setting `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)`.

# Important Rules
- If a diff application fails, re-read the file as it may have been updated.
- If type matching fails repeatedly, you can add #type: ignore and proceed.
- To run tests for specific files, use `rye run pytest [test files]`. Always run `rye run all` after successfully passing related tests.
